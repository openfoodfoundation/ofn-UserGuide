# Reports for Bulk Order Management

The reports available in the Bulk Coop section are ideal for enterprises on the OFN platform, such as buying groups, who use the [Group Buy feature](../products-1/group-buy-for-bulk-ordering.md).

There are four reports in this section are:

|                 | Use                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |

## Example: Bulk Co-op Suppliers Report

This report will show the following information:

* Did customers order enough of a product to justify ordering the bulk size from the supplier?
* How much extra product are customers willing to purchase to help the group reach the bulk size threshold (if [Group Buy](../products-1/group-buy-for-bulk-ordering.md#enabling-group-buy-for-a-product) is enabled)
* How many bulk sizes are required to meet customer demand?
* If the bulk size is ordered, how much stock will be left over.
* How many customers will be disappointed if this product isn’t ordered?

See the example below for an illustration of how the Bulk Co-op Totals by Supplier report can be used:

Example 1: Where the bulk ordering quantity has been reached:

![Radishes](../../.gitbook/assets/Radishess.png)

Example 2: where the bulk order quantity has not been reached:

![Bok Choy](../../.gitbook/assets/Bok-Choy.png)

* _Note the ‘Bulk Co-op Allocations’ report is similar in function to this report, but shows each customer’s order individually, rather than the cumulative total across all customers._
