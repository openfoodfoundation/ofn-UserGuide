# Reports

You can access reports by clicking on **Reports** in the blue horizontal menu. &#x20;

![](../../.gitbook/assets/screen-shot-2019-12-04-at-2.17.42-pm.png)

Here you will find a list of the pre-defined data exports that are available to view and download. All reports are available to download as a CSV file by selecting the **Download as CSV** checkbox when you specify the filters for each report. \


## All Reports

If you have opened an [Order Cycle](../shopfront/order-cycle/), you will be able to run reports to help with managing **packing,** **processing your orders**, and meet your **financial reporting** needs.

![Reports available to view and download](../../.gitbook/assets/screen-shot-2019-12-04-at-2.28.38-pm.png)

For most reports you are able to filter data by:

* date range
* hub name
* producer name
* order cycle name

{% hint style="info" %}
Hubs and shops who operate [continuously open order cycles](../shopfront/order-cycle/) may find using the Date filter when viewing reports useful.
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="success" %}
Filtering data by Hub and Producer name can be especially useful if you manage multiple enterprises on the platform.
{% endhint %}

## Reports for Suppliers&#x20;

If you have set [Permissions](../enterprise-profile/enterprise-to-enterprise-permissions-e2es.md) for a Hub to sell your products, and they have opened an [Order Cycle ](../shopfront/order-cycle/order-cycles-for-hubs.md)with your products listed, you will be able to run reports to pack and process your orders.&#x20;

{% hint style="success" %}
If you need to see Customer names in these reports, you can ask the Hub to make them visible in these reports.&#x20;
{% endhint %}

Hubs can make this change in their [Enterprise Settings](../enterprise-profile/enterprise-settings.md).

{% hint style="info" %}
HINTS:&#x20;

1. If you are a producer who supplies more than one food hub you can use the 'Hub' filter when viewing reports to identify which products you will be asked to deliver to each.
2. As a supplying producer you may not know the names of current open order cycles.  Filtering orders in your reports by date range is an easy alternative.
