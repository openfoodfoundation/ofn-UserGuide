# Reports

You can access reports by clicking on **Reports** in the blue horizontal menu. &#x20;

![](../../.gitbook/assets/screen-shot-2019-12-04-at-2.17.42-pm.png)

To customise your report there are two sections: filters and rendering options, which will allow you to access the relevant data from your report.

Here you will find a list of the pre-defined data exports that are available to view and download. All reports are available to download as in CSV, PDF and Excel and OpenOffice format. To select which file type you would like to download click the **Generate** **Report** drop down box where you specify the filters for each report.&#x20;

Reports displayed on the screen can be printed using the blue **Print Report** button in the top right corner of the report results:<img src="../../.gitbook/assets/print report.JPG" alt="" data-size="line">&#x20;

You can use the **Columns to hide** filter to make your reports easier to read you can remove unnecessary data from your report. To do this just specify which information you don't want displayed in the text box: <img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/Qh0uJbt76cQh-ryGCchdYybWp5X8KMdnG-VHLH-V1dU9pEniHMHOZc6mvuKzOdYM-NX4psrML2FhiLVTi45MCuKHDSD2UgQgo_Q5JsgEWRB-96m4jFbcRX1uQpUWpePstKXozJLW4efJD8P2D1rNMA4Bv8SSU3DhAQlMdX-Soq91r2qBf3l33XpS" alt="" data-size="line">

The **summary row** is a filter that adds totals to the bottom of each type of report and the **header row** gives you the name of the customer and order number above the data. This feature is available for **Packing reports** and **Orders & Fulfillment** reports.

## All Reports

If you have opened an [Order Cycle](../shopfront/order-cycle/), you will be able to run reports to help with managing **packing,** **processing your orders**, and meet your **financial reporting** needs.

![Reports available to view and download](../../.gitbook/assets/screen-shot-2019-12-04-at-2.28.38-pm.png)

For most reports you are able to filter data by:

* date range
* hub name
* producer name
* order cycle name

{% hint style="info" %}
Hubs and shops who operate [continuously open order cycles](../shopfront/order-cycle/) may find using the Date filter when viewing reports useful.
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="success" %}
Filtering data by Hub and Producer name can be especially useful if you manage multiple enterprises on the platform.
{% endhint %}

## Reports for Suppliers&#x20;

If you have set [Permissions](../enterprise-profile/enterprise-to-enterprise-permissions-e2es.md) for a Hub to sell your products, and they have opened an [Order Cycle ](../shopfront/order-cycle/order-cycles-for-hubs.md)with your products listed, you will be able to run reports to pack and process your orders.&#x20;

{% hint style="success" %}
If you need to see Customer names in these reports, you can ask the Hub to make them visible in these reports.&#x20;
{% endhint %}

Hubs can make this change in their [Enterprise Settings](../enterprise-profile/enterprise-settings.md).

{% hint style="info" %}
HINTS:&#x20;

1. If you are a producer who supplies more than one food hub you can use the 'Hub' filter when viewing reports to identify which products you will be asked to deliver to each.
2. As a supplying producer you may not know the names of current open order cycles.  Filtering orders in your reports by date range is an easy alternative.
