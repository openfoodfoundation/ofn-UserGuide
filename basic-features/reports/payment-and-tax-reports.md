# Payment  Reports

## Payment Reports

{% hint style="success" %}
The three Payment reports are good for keeping track of total incoming and outgoing revenue for your food hub within a time frame.
{% endhint %}

### Payment by Type

The simplest payment report. This documents the total of paid, balance due and credit owing for each different type of payment a hub may employ (ie. a total for Stripe payments, a total for cash/EFT payments and one for PayPal).

### Itemised Payment Totals

Listed by payment status (paid, balance due, credit owing) rather than payment provider, this report gives a breakdown of revenue (product costs, shipping fees) as well as the total.  The Outstanding balance column will be 0.0 for the payment status of 'paid'

### Payment Totals

In addition to the Itemised Payment Totals this report states revenue coming from EFT (cash or bank transfer) and Paypal separately.
