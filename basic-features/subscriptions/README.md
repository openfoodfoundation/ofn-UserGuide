## What are subscriptions? <a href="#what-are-subscriptions" id="what-are-subscriptions"></a>

Subscriptions are recurring or standing orders that can be set up for the customers of any Enterprise with a shopfront. Once set up, these orders will be automatically processed at defined intervals (eg. weekly, fortnightly, monthly).

{% hint style="success" %}
Subscriptions are convenient for customers, as they can know that their order will be processed without needing to remember to place their order.&#x20;
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="success" %}
Subscriptions are also a good way for an Enterprise to boost customer loyalty and make their order volumes more predictable.

* Customers can set up an automatic credit card payment (using [Stripe](../shopfront/payment-methods.md#integrated-payment-providers)) for their subscription
