{% hint style="danger" %}
To save a change of profile type, do not forget to click on "save" at the bottom of the window on the right.
{% endhint %}

You will then access a menu with multiple options. The exact options available varies between Enterprise type. This is an example for a Hub:

{% hint style="danger" %}
To save your changes, you must click "update" at the bottom of the page. It is recommended to save each page before changing pages.
{% endhint %}

This short video gives a quick insight into the steps and options detailed below:

![](<../../.gitbook/assets/enterprise settings 24.gif>)

## Primary Details

**Name:** This is the name of your enterprise. It will be the title of your profile (and shop).

**Primary Producer:** Select the producer box if you are a producer.

{% hint style="warning" %}
Only enterprises marked as Producers can add products to OFN. [Non-Producer Hubs](package-types.md#for-non-producers-hubs) only need to select this option if they retail mixed boxes which they pack and contain items from multiple producers.
{% endhint %}

**Visible in Search:** If your profile is ready to go public, select 'public', and your business will appear in the OFN's directory and map. Selecting 'hidden' will hide your profile in search and maps but still allow references in other shop profiles. 'Hide all references' will make your enteprise completely hidden on the platform. This will mean that only people with a direct URL to your shopfront (e.g. https://openfoodnetwork.org.uk/your-shop/shop) will be able to find your shopfront.

**Permalink:** You can customise part of the web address which will host your shop.

**Link to Shop Front:** This is the web address of your shop on the OFN (if you've chosen a profile type with shopfront). You can customise part of the URL above.

**OFN ID:** This identifier makes it possible to recognise your enterprise even if you decide to change its name and simplifies the work of the support team if necessary.

### Address

This information is used to geolocate your enterprise on the OFN map.  You can opt to manually enter the coordinates of your address if the location automatically calculated is incorrect.  This is useful for very rural locations.

![](../../.gitbook/assets/address.jpg)

Your exact address won't show if you are only registered as a Producer or Non-Producer Profile.  However if you are registered as a Shop or Hub your address will show in text form in your shop front's contact details tab.

### Contact

**Contact Name:** We ask for a contact name for the OFN’s records. This name will not be displayed on your profile, but will be included in order confirmation emails if you're running a shop.

**Email, Phone, WhatsApp phone number & Website:** These contact points will be listed on your OFN profile and shopfront as a means for others to make contact with you.  The WhatsApp phone number will automatically open 'WhatsApp' when selected.

### Social

**Facebook, Instagram, LinkedIn, Twitter:** Links to these pages will be created on your profile and shopfront.

### About

**Short description:** This will be displayed when your profile is viewed in the producers list. It should be under 1-2 sentences which briefly describe what you do.

**About Us:** This is a longer description of your enterprise. It will be shown when your profile is viewed in full. It should be between half a page and 1 pages long.

#### Business Address

The legally registered address and name of your community food organisation may differ from your trading address.  The details added to this section must correspond to the name and address registered with the legal body within your country of trading (eg. for the UK this would be the name and address registered with Companies House).

The legally registered address, along with company registration number and tax identifying number will be printed at the top of [invoices](../orders/view-orders.md) generated by OFN.

<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/business address.jpg" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

#### Invoice sorting

There is an option here to sort the items in each customer's invoice by supplier name.  This can be helpful if you print [invoices](../reports/view-orders.md#hints-and-tips) for all orders to aid with packing.

<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/invoice sorting.jpg" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

### Images

**Logo image:** This will be visible when your profile is viewed in brief, as a pop up window. It will also be shown on your profile. This image must be square (i.e. 100 x 100), or it will appear warped.  All images inserted here will be resized to 100 x 100 pixels.

**Promo image:** This image will run horizontally along the top of your profile page. It should be 1200 x 260 pixels in size.

An example profile is shown below in its complete version (from the map or shopfront pages).

![](../../.gitbook/assets/demohubimages1.jpg)

And now in its condensed version (from the producer listing page).

![](../../.gitbook/assets/demohubimages2.jpg)

### Properties&#x20;

{% hint style="warning" %}
Visible to **Producers** only
{% endhint %}

You can add properties (such as free range or certified organic) to your enterprise. These properties will then be automatically applied to **all** of your products.&#x20;

You can also specify properties for particular products only. This is useful if you stock both certified organic and ordinary groceries, for example. More information about this can be found [here](../products-1/product-properties.md).&#x20;

### Shipping Methods, Payment Methods & Enterprise Fees

{% hint style="warning" %}
Visible to enterprises registered as Shops or Hubs only (i.e. invisible for Producer/Non-Producer Profiles)
{% endhint %}

The [Shipping Methods](../shopfront/shipping-methods.md), [Payment Methods](../shopfront/payment-methods.md) and [Enterprise Fees](../shopfront/enterprise-fees.md) are covered in greater detail in later chapters in this user manual.

{% hint style="danger" %}
At least one method of **payment** and **delivery** must be setup to be able to open your online shopfront.
{% endhint %}

### Vouchers

Vouchers enabled by codes entered by the customer at checkout are covered in greater detail in[ later chapters ](../shopfront/vouchers.md)in this manual.

### Enterprise Permissions

These are links between suppliers and retailers enabling the latter to stock goods produced by the former.  More details can be found in [later chapters](enterprise-to-enterprise-permissions-e2es.md).

### Inventory Settings

{% hint style="warning" %}
Visible to Shop and Hub registered enterprises only.
{% endhint %}

For most enterprises the recommended setting can be used.

Advanced users who need greater flexibility with product management should consult the [Inventory](../products-1/inventory-tool.md) page of this guide before changing the settings.

### Tag Rules

{% hint style="warning" %}
Visible to Shop and Hub registered enterprises only.
{% endhint %}

Under this menu are all the 'tags' which have been assigned to the customers of your enterprise.

'Tags' are labels you apply to customers, products and other settings to assign differential access, pricing or other benefits to specific groups.  They are particularly useful if you wish to charge loyal customers or 'members' of your food hub preferential prices or allow them to pay by BACS rather than PayPal/Stripe.

For more information, visit the ['customer management and conditional displays/prices' section](../shopfront/customer-management-and-conditional-displays-prices/).

### Shop Preferences

{% hint style="warning" %}
Visible to Shop and Hub registered enterprises only.
{% endhint %}

**Shopfront Message**: This message is optional. If completed the message will be visible under a 'Notices' tab on the top menu bar.  Your shop (and its products) will appear under the 'Shop' tab.

![](../../.gitbook/assets/noticesoneoc.jpg)

![](../../.gitbook/assets/noticestwooc.jpg)

The Shopfront message or 'Notice' is an opportunity to provide basic information to the customer about how your store works. For example, you may explain how your order cycles are structured, or any membership requirements. It could also be a friendly greeting, or a chance to promote specials. You can include links to external websites (perhaps to showcase where your products are grown), social media and more.

If left blank the 'Notices' tab will not appear on your shop front.

![](../../.gitbook/assets/nonotices.jpg)

**Shopfront Closed Message**: This message will be displayed under both the 'Notices' AND 'Shop' tabs when your shopfront is closed (i.e. with no active order cycle). It’s a chance to tell customers when the shop will next be open and accepting orders.

{% hint style="success" %}
TIP: Copy and paste your 'Shopfront Message' into the Shopfront Closed Message. Then you can inform customers about how your shop works, link to external websites with more information about your products and ethics etc as well as inform them of when the next order cycle will open.
{% endhint %}

![Closed Shopfront with customised message](../../.gitbook/assets/closedmessageyes.jpg)

![Closed Shopfront with Default message](../../.gitbook/assets/closedmessageno.jpg)

**Shopfront Category Ordering**: By default, products are arranged alphabetically in your shop. You can also choose to display the products in a category order of your choosing. In this case, the products will be displayed in category order and then in alphabetical order within their category. E.g. you may wish to have your Meat & Fish products appear at the top, with your less important Pickles & Preserves appearing further down the shopfront.&#x20;

**Shopfront Producer Ordering**: As an alternative to organising the products listed in your shop front into those belonging to different categories, you can list items made by the same producer together.

**Sort order cycles on shopfront by:** If your shopfront has [more than one order cycle open at the same time](../shopfront/order-cycle/opening-more-than-one-order-cycle.md) you can select the order in which they appear on the shopfront. You may opt to sort them by closing date (closing soonest first) or by opening date (opening soonest first).

**Publicly visible shopfront?** If you select ‘public’, any shopper will be able to access your shopfront and place an order. If you select ‘visible to registered customers only’, shoppers who come to your shop will be prompted to login and only those users who are on your customers list will be given access to your shop. Learn more about the [private shop feature](../shopfront/private-shopfront.md).

**Guest Orders?** If you select ‘allow guest checkout’ shoppers won’t need to login to the OFN to shop with you, so they don't need to sign up and have a user account. If you want the extra security of knowing your customers must have an OFN account in order to have placed an order then select "require login to order".&#x20;

In order for a customer to have an OFN account they must have confirmed the email sent to them when registering with us.  Thus by selecting "require login to order" it may help limit the number of orders placed that are subsequently never collected as you know that the customer's order confirmation email will be sent to an active email account.

{% hint style="warning" %}
The 'Guest orders' setting is not applicable if you have opted for 'visible to registered customers only'.
{% endhint %}

**Display remaining number of items in shopfront if stock is low**: If the number of any particular product drops to 3 or less, then this will notify the customer in the shop front.

<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/low stock.jpg" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

**Change Orders:** We recommend the default setting of 'Placed orders cannot be changed or cancelled', especially if you allow 'guest customers' (i.e. people without an OFN account) to place orders.  This is so, as a shop or hub manager, you can keep track of payments received and refunds issued.  If a customer wishes to change their order you can still do so on their behalf, using the '[Edit Order](../orders/view-orders.md#editing-an-order)' functionality.

{% hint style="success" %}
_**Customers can change or cancel orders while an order cycle is open**_ is ONLY suitable if you use the **'cash/EFT/...**' [payment method](../shopfront/payment-methods.md) provider. &#x20;
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="danger" %}
Opting for 'customers can change or cancel orders while an order cycle is open' with an **automated** [payment provider](../shopfront/payment-methods.md) (Stripe/Paypal) is **strongly advised against**.
{% endhint %}

Opting for 'Customers can change or cancel orders while an order cycle is open' allows customers to change the quantities of **products already in their basket** **or cancel their order** altogether while the shop is open.  They will **not be able to add new products** to their original order - doing this will generate a 2nd order. &#x20;

{% hint style="danger" %}
[Refunds](../orders/refunds-and-adjusting-payments.md) will not be automatically issued to the customer, nor will additional funds be automatically collected.
{% endhint %}

**Subscriptions:** If you would like to offer to set up regular repeating orders for your customers then you can enable the [subscriptions](../subscriptions/) functionality here.

**Customer names in reports.** If you distribute products from other suppliers / producers, they will be able to run reports showing details of their products as sold through your Order Cycles. This option allows you to make the names of customers visible in these reports. Depending on the distribution model you have in place, this may be necessary for Producers to pack and distribute orders to the customers.



### Users

**Owner:** This is the email of the primary user responsible for this enterprise. They have the power to change all aspects of the profile. Only the owner can change the owner, choosing among the enterprise managers list. This user will have a star next to their name in the managers' field.

**Notifications:** This is the email of the user to whom the OFN system correspondence will be directed, i.e. order confirmations etc. Only the owner can nominate the user who will receive the notifications, among the enterprise managers list. This user will have an envelope symbol next to their name in the managers' field.

**Managers:** Other OFN users who have been granted permission to manage this account. Want to add a new manager? You can search for existing emails of users who have registered for an OFN account and add them as managers. If you don't find any user for the email you are looking for, the user doesn't exist yet on the OFN and you need to invite them (see next point).

**Invite manager:** This is for adding a manager who is not registered with OFN. When you add them they'll be sent an email confirmation, and when they confirm their email they'll be able to set a password and login to administer this enterprise.

### White label

In this menu you can customise the appearance of your OFN shop front to remove references to the platform.  More details are [found here](../shopfront/white-label-site.md).
