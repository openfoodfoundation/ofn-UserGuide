If your enterprise is a "producer" type (you checked the corresponding box in your profile settings), you can now [add products](products.md) and [related variants](product-variants.md) to your producer catalog. These products can be [added in bulk by importing a csv file ](product-and-inventory-import.md)(excel file saved in csv format).

The price entered for each product in the producer catalog is the full amount the producer will receive from a sale- hence a 'wholesale' price. Hubs (distributors) can add their fees for admin, transport and packing etc on top using fee options in [Shipping Methods](../shopfront/shipping-methods.md), [Payment Methods](../shopfront/payment-methods.md) or [Enterprise Fees](../shopfront/enterprise-fees.md).

{% hint style="info" %}
If you are a Hub managing a producer's enterprise profile on their behalf we recommend you do **not** incorporate your mark up into product prices, rather use the fee methods above.  This makes the product catalog more flexible for future changes.
{% endhint %}

If a hub wishes to change the price of a producer's products without using the Enterprise, Shipping or Payment Method Fees strategy then it is best to use our [Inventory](inventory-tool.md) feature.  By adding products to their shop inventory, hubs create a second catalog, independent of the product catalogs of their suppliers. Prices and stock levels in the Hub Inventory can be altered by the Hub without impacting on producers' 'master copies'.&#x20;

For [irregularly priced products](pricing-irregular-items-kg.md), such as a **whole chicken** with a price that varies from chicken to chicken depending on weight, there is an option to set a price 'per chicken' which can then be adjusted at the time of delivery to the specific piece of meat/vegetable.

The "[Bulk Buy Option](group-buy-for-bulk-ordering.md)" page details how Buying Groups can use OFN to organise and record bulk purchases.  For example, if a group buys rice in 25 kg bags then this function can help distribute the rice between customers based on a weight range they request on purchase.&#x20;
