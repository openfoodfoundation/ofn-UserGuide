# Orders

Once your shop is online (ie you have an active [Order Cycle](../shopfront/order-cycle/)) , customers are able to place orders. This section explains how to:&#x20;

* [manage and modify orders](view-orders.md)
* [create orders manually for customers](create-orders-manually.md)
* [adjust payments](refund-payments.md) (refunds etc)
