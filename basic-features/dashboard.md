# Dashboard

The Dashboard is where you can edit and manage your enterprise's features & settings on the Open Food Network platform. If you have chosen to register your enterprise as a [shop](../your-quick-start-on-ofn-given-who-you-are.md#shop) or [hub](../your-quick-start-on-ofn-given-who-you-are.md#hub) then you can also edit your products and order cycles from the Dashboard.&#x20;

Access your dashboard from the homepage by first logging in and then clicking on the Profile Icon in the top right hand corner and selecting **Administration** from the drop-down menu.

The options you will see on your dashboard will depend on which enterprise type you choose on [registration](register-and-create-your-profile.md). The screenshots below show the dashboard view for different types of users.
