# Vouchers

Voucher codes can be created to offer shopping discounts to new or existing customers. Voucher functionality is still relatively limited, please read through [this guide before implementing vouchers in your shop process](../../hub-management-tips/how-tos/vouchers-v.-tags.md).&#x20;

{% hint style="info" %}
Vouchers is in 'beta' mode, meaning it's a new feature that may still have some glitches. Please [contact us](https://www.openfoodnetwork.org/find-your-local-open-food-network/) with any feedback about what works, what needs improving or how it could be better explained.
