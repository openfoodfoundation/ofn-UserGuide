# Customer management and conditional displays/prices

Often an enterprise may want to offer individual customers and wholesale retailers different prices (or even different products- such as bulk buys).

For some enterprises (such as community food groups) 'members' may be eligible to reduced rates in comparison to 'non members'.

'[**Tags and Tag rules**](tags-and-tag-rules.md)' are the mechanism on the OFN platform whereby differential pricing and other benefits can be imparted to specific customer groups, if desired.

For step-by-step guides on how to implement tags and tag rules to provide specific functionalities view the [How To section here](../../../hub-management-tips/how-tos/).
