# Vouchers v. tags

Before we cover different hints and tips on how to offer sub sets of customers differential pricing or benefits, it is worth noting that there are two primary ways in which this functionality can be achieved on the OFN platform:

* [Vouchers](../../basic-features/shopfront/vouchers.md)
* [Tags and tag rules](../../basic-features/shopfront/customer-management-and-conditional-displays-prices/tags-and-tag-rules.md)

Both features have their benefits and disadvantages.  Hence it is balancing all this information, to work out the 'right' method which would allow your enterprise to achieve the desired outcome.

It is worth noting that the Voucher Feature is beta at present and still undergoing development. The scope of vouchers may increase in the future.
