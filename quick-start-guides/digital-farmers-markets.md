# Digital Farmer's Markets

Farmersâ€™ Markets have the option to setup as a [group](../basic-features/groups/) of individually managed [shops](../your-quick-start-on-ofn-given-who-you-are.md#shop) (Option 1) or as a centrally managed [hub](../your-quick-start-on-ofn-given-who-you-are.md#hub) (Option 2).

### Option 1: Multi-vendor Market

* Contact each vendor at your Farmer's Market and ask them to set up a shop for their produce.  You may wish to give them a link to [this quick start guide](producer-shop-quick-setup-guide.md).
* Contact your [local OFN support team](../local-ofn-organizations-and-contacts.md) and ask for them to set up a [group](../basic-features/groups/) for your farmer's market. &#x20;

Once your Farmer's Market Group has been created you will be able to [manage its content](../basic-features/groups/group-page.md)
{% endhint %}

### Option 2: Hub

* As overall manager of your Farmer's market, follow [this quick start guide to setting up a Hub](multi-producers-shop-hub-quick-setup-guide.md) on the OFN platform.
* Individual suppliers to your market should follow [this guide to setting up as Profiles](profile-only-quick-setup-guide.md) on the OFN platform.
