# Our values

We have collectively written a set of 9 values that drive our actions:

* Global Commons
* Relationships
* Ecosystems
* Transparency
* Empowerment
* Subsidiarity
* People first
* Constant evolution
* Systemic change

You can discover and learn more about them [on the global OFN website](https://openfoodnetwork.org/about/values/) and through [that animation](https://prezi.com/tf6t5kkno790/view/#1).
