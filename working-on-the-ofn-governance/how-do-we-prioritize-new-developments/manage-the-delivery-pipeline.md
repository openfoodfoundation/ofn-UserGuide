# Curate the delivery pipeline

So we will have in permanence lots of different issues competing to enter the delivery pipeline:

* features answering prioritized unmet needs
* bugs
* tech debt issues and automated testing issues
* sys admin tasks

In order to feed the delivery pipe to ensure the sustainability and maintainability of our product, we need to make sure that tech debt is taken into account, that painful bugs get solved and that prioritized unmet needs get met.

* What tech debt/sys admin task do we need to fix in priority?
* Among the features selected to satisfy the unmet needs, which ones can we reasonably incept and implement in the month to come?
* What bugs do we put in the pipeline?

Delivery circle is in charge of keeping the pipe balanced.
