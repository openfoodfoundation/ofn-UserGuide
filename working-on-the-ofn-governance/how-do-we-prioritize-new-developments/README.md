# Software improvement process

There are four type of improvement that we need to deal with in parallel:

* fix the **bugs**
* develop **new features to satisfy needs** **that are not yet satisfied**
* follow the **upgrades of the "modules" we have built our software on** (called "dependencies"). If we don't do it, we accumulate what we call a "**tech debt**", that we will anyway need to deal with sometime. If we don't do it regularly, then we have do pay the interests of not having done it.
* improve the **administration system setup** to make upgrades and maintenance of the local platforms easier.
