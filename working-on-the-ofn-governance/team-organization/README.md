# Team organization

The OFN global team is composed of:

* **developers and user experience designers**, who have more a technical background. They manage the OFN code base and administrate the servers for local instances.
* **product owners, testers, and project coordinators** who have more a customer, product strategy and project management view.
* **content producers** working more on communication and sector development side.

Among those contributors, some are occasional contributors, and other work on a daily basis on the OFN project and are called "**the core certified team**".

The processes below explain how new contributors join and exit the core team, and how much they are paid.

For developers, this process has been specified with some technical commitments [on this wiki page](https://github.com/openfoodfoundation/openfoodnetwork/wiki/Pipeline-development-process).
