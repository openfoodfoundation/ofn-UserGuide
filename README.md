# Introduction

The aim of this handbook is to explain how the OFN community works to the people who are developing OFN communities and products worldwide.\
\
We'll explain in here what is the Open Food Network, what is the context that motivated the project, what is our vision, what are our values. What do we do concretely. Who is the OFN team, and what are the roles the people are fulfilling while working in OFN. We will also explain the governance, economic and legal models of the OFN, and how we concretly operate as a team, our processes.

We hope you enjoy! If you have any suggestion or want to contact us, write to [hello@openfoodnetwork.org](mailto:hello@openfoodnetwork.org).
